# SmartRestaurant

This is a simple Android application developed for the first assignment of
Self Adaptive and Self Managing Systems. It uses the GPS sensor in the phone
to get the current location and then uses this location to query the Google
Places API to find nearby restaurants. Information about these restaurants is
then displayed to the user.
